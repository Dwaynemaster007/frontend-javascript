# 📘 0x04-TypeScript: A Journey into Type-Safe JavaScript

Welcome to the `0x04-TypeScript` project! This repository contains a series of hands-on tasks designed to teach fundamental and advanced concepts in TypeScript. From basic interfaces to complex namespace merging and nominal typing, this project covers essential skills for modern frontend development.

## 🚀 Key Concepts Covered

- **Interfaces**: Defining and implementing clear data structures.
- **Classes**: Creating reusable object blueprints with type safety.
- **Namespaces**: Organizing and structuring code to avoid global scope pollution.
- **Declaration Merging**: Extending existing types and interfaces.
- **Nominal Typing**: Using brand properties to create unique, non-interchangeable types.
- **Modern Tooling**: Setting up a complete development environment with Webpack, ESLint, and a local server.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is divided into several tasks, each focusing on a specific concept.

- **`task_0`**: Introduction to TypeScript, setting up a basic project, and defining interfaces.
- **`task_1`**: Exploring basic interfaces and types.
- **`task_2`**: Working with classes and interfaces.
- **`task_3`**: Understanding ambient namespaces.
- **`task_4`**: Advanced concepts of namespace and declaration merging.
- **`task_5`**: Implementing nominal typing using brand conventions.

## 🔧 Installation & Usage

To run any of the tasks, navigate to its specific directory, install the dependencies, and start the development server.

1.  **Navigate to a task directory**:
    ```bash
    cd task_5
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run start-dev
    ```
    This will start a local server with hot-reloading, allowing you to see your changes live.
